<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(|G|\)</span> to be the number of vertices in <span class="math inline">\(|G|\)</span>.</p>
<p>We construct a graph <span class="math inline">\(G\in \mathbb{G}_T^2\)</span> recursively. For each <span class="math inline">\(T_v\)</span>, we construct a <span class="math inline">\(G_v\)</span> on the same vertex set such that it has the property there exist a vertex that connects to all other vertex in <span class="math inline">\(G_v\)</span>. Call such vertex a golden vertex of <span class="math inline">\(G_v\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(G_v\)</span> would be a union of all <span class="math inline">\(G_u\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is a child of <span class="math inline">\(T_v\)</span> with some extra edges. Let <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> to be the child of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(G_u\)</span> has the maximum number of vertices (break ties arbitrarily), and <span class="math inline">\(u&#39;\)</span> is the golden vertex of <span class="math inline">\(G_u\)</span>, then we add edges from <span class="math inline">\(u&#39;\)</span> to all other vertices in <span class="math inline">\(G_v\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(G=G_r\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the root of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p>
<p>The distance between any two vertex is at most <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(G[V(T_v))]=G_v\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, because any two vertex is connected by a golden vertex in the induced subgraph.</p>
<p>The number of edges is at most <span class="math inline">\(O(n\log n)\)</span>. Label <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(|T_v|\)</span>. The number of edges added at the step to build <span class="math inline">\(G_v\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(|T_v|-|T_u|\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(G_u\)</span> contains the golden vertex, and it also have the most number of vertices among all <span class="math inline">\(G_c\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is a child of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Sum of all labels over the tree <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> except the heaviest child is <span class="math inline">\(O(n\log n)\)</span> using analysis akin to heavy-light decomposition.</p>
</section>
<p>This bound is in fact best possible by considering a complete binary tree and the following lemma:</p>
<section class="theorem-environment Lemma" id="Lemma-2">
<span class="theorem-header"><span class="type">Lemma</span><span class="index">2</span></span>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(G=(V,E)\)</span> is a graph with diameter <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, then for any cut <span class="math inline">\(\delta(U)\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(|\delta(U)|\geq min(|U|,|V\setminus U|)\)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section class="theorem-environment Proof" id="Proof-">
<span class="theorem-header"><span class="type">Proof</span></span>
<p>wlog, let <span class="math inline">\(|U|\leq |V\setminus U|\)</span>. If all vertex in <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> has an neighbor in <span class="math inline">\(V\setminus U\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(|\delta(U)|\geq |U|\)</span> and we are done. Otherwise, there is an vertex <span class="math inline">\(u\in U\)</span> has no neighbor in <span class="math inline">\(V\setminus U\)</span>, then for any <span class="math inline">\(v\not\in U\)</span>, there is an <span class="math inline">\(u&#39;\in U\)</span>, and there is a path <span class="math inline">\(uu&#39;v\)</span>. This implies there are at least <span class="math inline">\(|V|\)</span> edges in <span class="math inline">\(\delta(U)\)</span>.</p>
</section>
<p>Is this the best possible for general <span class="math inline">\(G_T^k\)</span> too? Not at all. To show this, we introduce an algorithmic problem.</p>
<section class="theorem-environment Problem" id="Problem-3">
<span class="theorem-header"><span class="type">Problem</span><span class="index">3</span></span>
<p>Preprocess a rooted tree <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> where the elements in the tree <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> has weights from a semigroup <span class="math inline">\((S,+)\)</span>, such that we can answer the following query in <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> semigroup operations.</p>
<p><strong>Query Input</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is an ancestor of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Query Output</strong>: The sum of weights of the unique simple path between <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
</section>
<p>Alon and Schieber showed this problem can be solved by precompute <span class="math inline">\(O(n\lambda(k,n))\)</span> path sums <span class="citation" data-cites="Alon87optimalpreprocessing">[<a href="#ref-Alon87optimalpreprocessing">1</a>]</span>. Where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda(k,n)\)</span> is related to the inverse Ackermann function, and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda(4,n)=O(n\log^*n)\)</span>.</p>
<section class="theorem-environment Theorem" id="Theorem-4">
<span class="theorem-header"><span class="type">Theorem</span><span class="index">4</span></span>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices, then <span class="math inline">\(G_T^k\)</span> have <span class="math inline">\(O(n \lambda(k,n))\)</span> edges.</p>
</section>
<section class="theorem-environment Proof" id="Proof-">
<span class="theorem-header"><span class="type">Proof</span></span>
<p>A simple reduction from our tree problem by input our rooted tree <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> into Alon and Schieber's algorithm. For each path sum they preprocess, we create an edge in our <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. The diameter of all <span class="math inline">\(G_v\)</span> is at most <span class="math inline">\(2k\)</span>, since for any 2 vertices <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, we find it's lowest common ancestor <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, then there is a path of length <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> and another of length at most <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
</section>
<p>Their paper argued an lower bound of preprocess <span class="math inline">\(\Omega(n\lambda_k(n))\)</span> path sums for a single rooted path. In our model, we can add <span class="math inline">\(O(n)\)</span> edges is sufficient. An edge from the leaf to every other vertex, making the diameter only <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. This is because we have a lot more freedom in our diameter problem.</p>
<p>In their problem, their path sum is actually divide the path into <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> subpaths, our path of length <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> would imply there is an overlap in the sum.</p>
<p>One might to think the reason we can do it in <span class="math inline">\(O(n)\)</span> edges comes directly from in the undirected model we can traverse back from the leaf and allow overlaps. Maybe the following problem might give us an lower bound.</p>
<section class="theorem-environment Problem" id="Problem-5">
<span class="theorem-header"><span class="type">Problem</span><span class="index">5</span></span>
<p>Preprocess a rooted tree <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> where the elements in the tree <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> has weights from a semigroup <span class="math inline">\((S,+)\)</span>, such that we can answer the following query in <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> semigroup operations.</p>
<p><strong>Query Input</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is an ancestor of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is a leaf.</p>
<p><strong>Query Output</strong>: The sum of weights of any walk lies strictly in between <span class="math inline">\(xy\)</span> and that start at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and ends at <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
</section>
<p>Unfortunately, this does not give us an lower bound. Following the proof in Alon's and Schieber's paper, we can show any algorithm would need to precompute at least <span class="math inline">\(O(n\lambda_k(n))\)</span> paths in order to output the solution using <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> semigroup operations on this particular tree: <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is a rooted tree consist of one single path of length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and for each vertex, we add one single dangling leaf.</p>
<p>Again, for this graph, we can add at most <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> edges and force diameter to be at most <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. Take the lowest leaf and add edge to all other vertices. Here would be an formulation that could result an lower bound.</p>
<section class="theorem-environment Problem" id="Problem-6">
<span class="theorem-header"><span class="type">Problem</span><span class="index">6</span></span>
<p>Preprocess a rooted tree <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> where the elements in the tree <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> has weights from a semigroup <span class="math inline">\((S,+)\)</span>, such that we can answer the following query in <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> semigroup operations.</p>
<p><strong>Query Input</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is an ancestor of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Query Output</strong>: The sum of weights of any walk from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> that lies strictly inside the subtree rooted at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
</section>
<p>Finally, here is a conjecture. Instead of using tree, we use Laminar family to simplify the wording of the conjecture.</p>
<section class="theorem-environment Conjecture" id="Conjecture-7">
<span class="theorem-header"><span class="type">Conjecture</span><span class="index">7</span></span>
<p>For every constant <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, there exist a Laminar family <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> over ground set <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices, such that for any graph <span class="math inline">\(G=(V,E)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(G[A]\)</span> has diameter at most <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(A\in X\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(|E|=\Omega(n\lambda_k(n))\)</span>.</p>
</section>
<p>If diameter is <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, then we can show there is a <span class="math inline">\(\Omega(n\log \log n)\)</span> lower bound by consider the Laminar family such that a set of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> gets partitioned into <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{n}\)</span> children each with <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{n}\)</span> vertices, and it is applied recursively.</p>
<p>The idea is at any level, say has <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> elements and <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{n}\)</span> subsets. A vertex is called interior if it does not connect to any vertex outside the subset, and exterior otherwise. A subset is shy if it contains a interior vertex. We show there is at least <span class="math inline">\(1/5 n\)</span> edges in between the subsets. If there are at least <span class="math inline">\(1/2n\)</span> exterior vertices, then we are done. Otherwise, there are at lease <span class="math inline">\(1/2n\)</span> interior vertices. We call the subsets with at least one interior vertex shy. At least <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{n}/2\)</span> of those subsets are shy. Consider any two distinct shy subset and pick a interior vertex from each. In order to have a distance 3 path between two interior vertices, the path has to contain two exterior vertex, one in each shy subset. But this shows if we contract all the shy subsets to one vertex, we get a clique. This means there has to be at least <span class="math inline">\((\sqrt{n}/2-1)^2&gt;1/5n\)</span> edges in between the subsets (for large enough <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>).</p>
