<h1 id="finger-trees"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Finger trees</h1>
<p>Consider a data structure <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> that maintains a sequence of monoid elements from <span class="math inline">\((M,\cdot)\)</span>. Say, the sequence is <span class="math inline">\(a_1,\ldots,a_n\)</span>. It has four operations. All time are amortized and not worst case.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(split(S,p)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p:M\to \{0,1\}\)</span> is a monotonic predicate on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(p(ab)\geq p(a)\)</span>. It split the sequence at position <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(p(\prod_{i=1}^j a_i) = 0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(j &lt; t\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(p(\prod_{i=1}^j a_i) = 1\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(j\geq t\)</span>. This takes <span class="math inline">\(O(\log \min(n,n-t))\)</span> time.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(concat(S,T)\)</span>, concatenate sequence represented by <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and the sequence represented by <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. If the length of the sequences are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, respectively, then this operation takes <span class="math inline">\(O(\log \min(n,m))\)</span> time.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(product(S)\)</span>, returns <span class="math inline">\(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> time.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(map(S,f)\)</span>, apply <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to every entry in the sequence. So <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> would represent <span class="math inline">\(f(a_1),\ldots,f(a_n)\)</span>. This operation takes <span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> time.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There is one operation <span class="math inline">\(Empty()\)</span> that produce an empty sequence.</p>
<p>We have to first make a few assumptions: All monoid operations take <span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> time. All map we consider can be evaluated in <span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> time AND we can compute <span class="math inline">\(h = f\circ g\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> time. Note this means we compute (a representation) of the function <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> itself, and we can use this representation to compute <span class="math inline">\(h(x)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> time.</p>
<p>Otherwise, all &quot;<span class="math inline">\(O(T)\)</span> time&quot; should be replaced with &quot;<span class="math inline">\(O(T)\)</span> monoid operation, function evaluation, function composition and constant time operations.&quot;.</p>
<p>Such data structure exists. The first <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> operation are supported by finger tree <span class="citation" data-cites="Hinze2006">[<a href="#ref-Hinze2006">1</a>]</span>. It is not hard to add the last operation, the idea is to tag nodes with an function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>(in the beginning <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is just the identity), and it means &quot;apply <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to everything below!&quot;. It propagate only when the lower level nodes need to be accessed, therefore the cost would be charged into the other operations. Many other binary search trees probably can implement these operations too. For example, if the dynamic optimality conjecture for splay tree is true, it be best to use splay tree for implementation. However, that's beside the point. The point is to have an abstract data structure over a monoid sequence. The abstraction deals away with all the mess hidden by the data structure.</p>
<h1 id="extend-its-power"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Extend its power</h1>
<p>Finger tree can be extended to query elements by giving indices of the element: take the Cartesian product of the monoid and <span class="math inline">\((\N,+)\)</span>, and we get a new monoid. So we can just assume our data structure has the following extensions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(splitAt(S,i)\)</span>, split the sequence to two sequence <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> at the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th index in <span class="math inline">\(O(\log \min(n,n-i))\)</span> time.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(insertAt(S,i, x)\)</span>, insert element to the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th position.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(delete(S,i)\)</span>, delete the element at <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th position.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Another interesting extension is allowing one to <span class="math inline">\(reverse(S)\)</span> the sequence in <span class="math inline">\(O(\log n)\)</span> time. This become much more complicated.</p>
<h1 id="application"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Application</h1>
<p>There are some common application of finger trees.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Stack, queue, dequeue with product operation, all amortized constant time. As a special case, it would solve the <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-and-implement-special-stack-data-structure/">min stack problem</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Random access sequence, which is related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_%28data_structure%29">rope</a> data structure.</p></li>
<li><p>Ordered sequence(sorted list).</p></li>
<li><p>Priority queues.</p></li>
<li><p>Interval trees, segment trees.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Most of the above has been described in <span class="citation" data-cites="Hinze2006">[<a href="#ref-Hinze2006">1</a>]</span>, but we will talk about two specifics that usually not mentioned by others.</p>
<h2 id="merge-sorted-lists-in-optimal-time-bound"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Merge sorted lists in optimal time bound</h2>
<section class="theorem-environment Theorem" id="Theorem-1">
<span class="theorem-header"><span class="type">Theorem</span><span class="index">1</span></span>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> are two ordered sequences of length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, respectively. <span class="math inline">\(n\leq m\)</span>. Both ordered sequences are represented by finger trees. Compute the finger tree representation of <span class="math inline">\(S\cup T\)</span> takes <span class="math inline">\(O(n\log \frac{m}{n})\)</span> time.</p>
</section>
<p>Split <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> pieces one by one by split along the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th element of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to the second part of the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th produced piece for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, then concatenate all of them. The splitting takes <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^n \log t_i\)</span> time, where <span class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span> is the size of the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th piece. By concavity, we have the time for split is <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^n \log t_i \leq n \log \frac{m}{n}\)</span>, and concatenation time is similar.</p>
<h2 id="solve-the-klees-measure-problem"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Solve the Klee's measure problem</h2>
<p>This section shows how the map operation is quite crucial because we can make <em>range updates</em>.</p>
<p>The motivation came from the following question. Can finger tree substitute for the <a href="http://letuskode.blogspot.com/2013/01/segtrees.html">popular competitive programming data structure segment tree</a>, a special case of the real <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment_tree">segment tree</a>? This is not possible, and it's not because the large hidden constants. The abstract definition in this article goes cannot do the following common operation on an sequence of integers: increment the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th number by <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. This operation make little sense if we allow insert and deletions, but many use of segment tree do not consider insert and deletes.</p>
<p>Fortunately, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klee%27s_measure_problem">Klee's measure problem</a>, the problem that caused the invention of segment tree can be solved with a finger tree. We show how to solve it in 1D. It's well known how to <a href="http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/17252/number-of-maximum-overlap-in-n-dimensions/17374">use it for solving the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>D version</a>.</p>
<p>We produce another data structure, such that each operation takes <span class="math inline">\(O(\log n)\)</span> amortized time. Where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of times we called insert.</p>
<p>We maintain a collection of intervals with data structure <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, there are 3 operations.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(insert(D,a,b)\)</span>, insert interval <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span> into the collection.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(delete(D,a,b)\)</span>. Delete a interval <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span> from the collection, we assume it's always a interval inserted before.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(measure(D)\)</span>. Find the measure of the union of all intervals in the collection.</li>
</ol>
<section class="theorem-environment Remark" id="Remark-">
<span class="theorem-header"><span class="type">Remark</span></span>
<p>It can be sharpened such that <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of intervals inside the data structure. We just do a global rebuild if the number of interval doubled or reduced to half since the last global update. Also, <span class="math inline">\(measure()\)</span> actually only take constant time.</p>
</section>
<p>The finger tree stores a sequence of elementary intervals that partitions the space, and how many copies of that interval exists. Thus we can represent it as <span class="math inline">\(((l,r),c)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\((l,r)\)</span> is the elementary interval with left and right boundary, and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is the number of copies.</p>
<p>To insert a interval, consider it's left point <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>. The data structure find a elementary interval contains <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>, and split it into two elementary intervals. Similarly, we do the same with the right endpoint. This takes <span class="math inline">\(O(\log n)\)</span> time, and we increase the number of elementary intervals by at most <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(increment\)</span> is an automorphism defined as <span class="math inline">\(increment(((a,b),c))=((a,b),c+1)\)</span>. For each insertion of interval <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(increment\)</span> gets applied to all elementary interval in the range. For deletion, we apply <span class="math inline">\(decrement = increment^{-1}\)</span> instead.</p>
<p>The monoid product is simply <span class="math inline">\(\prod_{i=1}^n ( (l_i, r_i),c) = \sum_{i=1}^n \min(c,1)(r_i-l_i)\)</span>, and this is exactly what <span class="math inline">\(measure(D)\)</span> should output.</p>
<h2 id="the-local-ranking-sequence"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> The local ranking sequence</h2>
<p>The ranking sequence of a sequence of distinct numbers <span class="math inline">\(a_1,\ldots,a_n\)</span> is defined as <span class="math inline">\(b_1,\ldots,b_n\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span>th smallest element. Given a sequence of unique integers <span class="math inline">\(a_1,\ldots,a_n\)</span>, we want to design a data structure to query <span class="math inline">\(Q(i,j)\)</span>, which returns the ranking sequence of <span class="math inline">\(a_i,\ldots,a_j\)</span>.</p>
<p>This can be solved by storing sorted subsequences. We just have to return sorted sequence of <span class="math inline">\(a_i,\ldots,a_j\)</span> during the query, and then it become simple to figure out the ranking sequence. This will make sure the running time for <span class="math inline">\(Q(i,j)\)</span> to be <span class="math inline">\(O(j-i)\)</span>. There are a few other variants, but seems quite hard to adopt a finger tree for <span class="citation" data-cites="Chang2012517">[<a href="#ref-Chang2012517">2</a>]</span>.</p>
