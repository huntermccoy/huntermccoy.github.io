          <h1 id="article-title">More algorithms on perfectly balanced photo gallery</h1>
          <br />
<div>
<p>Recently there was <a href="http://www.crispymtn.com/stories/the-algorithm-for-a-perfectly-balanced-photo-gallery">an article</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/jtreitz">Johannes Treitz</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6198400">submitted to Hacker News</a> about how to display a set of pictures as nicely as possible. The article doesn't have a formal description of the problem, so here is my take on what it mean by perfectly balanced.</p>
<section class="theorem-environment Problem" id="Problem-1">
<span class="theorem-header"><span class="type">Problem</span><span class="index">1</span></span>
<p>Given a sequence of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> rectangles where the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th rectangle has width <span class="math inline">\(W_i\)</span> and height <span class="math inline">\(H_i\)</span>. Also given are width <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> and target height <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. Partition the sequence to <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> consecutive subsequences, such that we scale the rectangles keeping the aspect ratio, and each subsequence of rectangles fills the entire width <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, and is close to the target height <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>.</p>
</section>
<p>The problem is not so well defined. To make sure the heights are close, do we minimize the sum of all differences? Minimize the maximum difference? Or maybe, we just want to minimize the difference between consecutive rows, such that the first row has height close to <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in real applications, the exact definition doesn't matter that much. Treitz reduce the problem to the linear partition problem.</p>
<section class="theorem-environment Problem" id="Problem-2">
<span class="theorem-header"><span class="type">Problem</span><span class="index">2</span></span>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(a_1,\ldots,a_n\)</span> be a sequence of positive reals. We want to partition it into <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> consecutive subsequences, such that the maximum sum over each subsequence is minimized. Formally, find <span class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span> positions <span class="math inline">\(b_1=1,b_2,\ldots,b_{k},b_{k+1}=n\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(\max_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{j=b_i}^{b_{i+1}} a_j\)</span> is minimized.</p>
</section>
<p><span class="math inline">\(a_i = W_i/H_i\)</span> is the aspect ratio. This article will explore the techniques to solve the problem in <span class="math inline">\(O(kn)\)</span> time. It is only a high level overview, and leaves the details unfilled.</p>
<h1 id="minimize-total-difference"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Minimize total difference</h1>
<p>Let's first consider a simpler problem for demonstration.</p>
<section class="theorem-environment Problem" id="Problem-3">
<span class="theorem-header"><span class="type">Problem</span><span class="index">3</span></span>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(a_1,\ldots,a_n\)</span> be a sequence of positive reals. We want to partition it into <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> consecutive subsequences, such that the total difference between the sum of each consecutive sequence and the average sum of the whole sequence is minimized. Formally, let <span class="math inline">\(\mu = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\)</span>. Find <span class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span> positions <span class="math inline">\(b_1=1,b_2,\ldots,b_k,b_{k+1}=n\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^{k} |\sum_{j=b_i}^{b_{i+1}} a_j - \mu|\)</span> is minimized.</p>
</section>
<p>We will solve this problem with a reduction to a problem on a DAG, and then apply dynamic programming. Since we can always turn a problem that ask us to find the <em>cost</em> to a problem that ask us to find a <em>construction</em> that achieve the cost(with the same time/space bound). We will only concern with the cost version of the problem as it's much clearer. (One can implement some arrows in Haskell to make DP for construction as easy as DP for cost, sounds like a nice project. )</p>
<p>Build a directed graph <span class="math inline">\(D(V,A)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(V=\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((v_i,v_j)\in A\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(i\leq j\)</span>. (We can make it <span class="math inline">\(i &lt; j\)</span> instead, depend on if we consider a empty sequence a valid sequence.)</p>
<p>We have a weight function <span class="math inline">\(w(i,j)\)</span> that assign weights to arc <span class="math inline">\((v_i,v_j)\)</span>. Define <span class="math inline">\(w(i,j) = |\sum_{k=i}^{j-1} a_i - \mu|\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we find a <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-edge path of minimum weight from <span class="math inline">\(v_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(v_n\)</span>, then this implies a solution to <a href="#Problem-3">Problem 3</a>.</p>
<h1 id="solve-the-minimum-weight-k-edge-path-problem"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Solve the minimum weight <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-edge path problem</h1>
<p>Define <span class="math inline">\(C(d,i)\)</span> to be the <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-edge path from <span class="math inline">\(v_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(v_i\)</span> with minimum weight. We want to find <span class="math inline">\(C(k,n)\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
C(d,i) = \min_{1\leq j\leq i} {C(d-1,j) + w(j,i)}
\]</span></p>
<p>If we set <span class="math inline">\(w(j,i)=\infty\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(j&gt;i\)</span>, then we have a better representation.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
C(d,i) = \min_{1\leq j\leq n} {C(d-1,j) + w(j,i)}
\]</span></p>
<p>There are <span class="math inline">\(kn\)</span> entries in the DP table for <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C(d,i)\)</span> requires <span class="math inline">\(O(n)\)</span> time to compute. This means the algorithm will take <span class="math inline">\(O(kn^2)\)</span> time.</p>
<h1 id="improve-the-time-complexity"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Improve the time complexity</h1>
<p>There is a standard technique on totally monotone matrices that can reduce the complexity of the problem to <span class="math inline">\(O(kn)\)</span>.</p>

<section class="theorem-environment Proof" id="Proof-">
<span class="theorem-header"><span class="type">Proof</span></span>
Let <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{k=i+1}^{j-1} a_i - \mu = m\)</span>
<span class="math">\begin{align*}
w(i,j)+w(i+1,j+1) &=  |\sum_{k=i}^{j-1} a_i - \mu|
                    + |\sum_{k=i+1}^{j} a_i - \mu|\\
                  &= |a_i + m| + |a_j + m|\\

                  &= w(i,j+1)+w(i+1,j)
\end{align*}</span>
<p>To prove the <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span>, see that <span class="math inline">\(a_i,a_j\)</span> are positive, one can consider either <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is negative or positive, and notice either way the inequality holds true.</p>

<section class="theorem-environment Theorem" id="Theorem-7">
<span class="theorem-header"><span class="type">Theorem</span><span class="index">7</span></span>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is Monge, then <span class="math inline">\(M^d\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> totally monotone matrix.</p>
</section>
<p>Using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMAWK_algorithm">SMAWK algorithm</a>, all column minimas can be found in <span class="math inline">\(O(n)\)</span>. Finding <span class="math inline">\(C(d,i)\)</span> takes only <span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> time on average!</p>
<p>Here is the very simple code to show how this can be done easily if we have a <a href="http://dailyhaskellexercise.tumblr.com/post/57781874558/column-minima-in-a-totally-monotone-matrix">Haskell implementation of the SMAWK algorithm</a>. The indexing is a bit different from the description in the article.</p>
<pre><code>import Data.Array
import SMAWK

minCostkEdgePath k n w = d!(k-1,n)
  where
    d = array ((0,0),(k-1,n)) [ ((i,j), f i j) | i&lt;-[0..k-1],j&lt;-[0..n]]
    f 0 i = w 0 i
    f k i = m k (p!(k,i)) i
    p = array ((1,0),(k,n)) [((z,i),t) |z&lt;-[1..k],(i,t)&lt;-zip [0..n] (columnMinima (m z) (n+1) (n+1))]
    m k j i = (+) (d!(k-1,j)) (w j i)

minCostMuPartition k xs = minCostkEdgePath k n w
    where 
        w i j 
         | i &lt;= j    = abs $! s!j - s!i - avg
         | otherwise = 2*m
        s   = listArray (0, n-1) $ scanl (+) 0 xs
        n   = length xs
        m   = sum xs
        avg = m/fromIntegral k</code></pre>
<h1 id="solve-the-linear-partition-problem"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Solve the linear partition problem</h1>
<p>Now, returning to the original problem. Again, we can reduce the problem to a problem on a directed graph. This time, <span class="math inline">\(w(i,j) = \sum_{k=i}^{j-1} a_i\)</span>. The weight of a path is the maximum weight of the edges in the path. A <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-edge path with minimum weight implies the solution to the original problem.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
C(d,i) = \min_{1\leq j\leq n} M^d_{j,i}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(M^d_{j,i} = \max (C(d-1,j),w(j,i))\)</span>.</p>
<p>Just like <a href="#Problem-3">Problem 3</a>, this describes a <span class="math inline">\(O(kn^2)\)</span> time algorithm. Compare <span class="math inline">\(w,C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M^d\)</span> with the previous problem to see there isn't much difference.</p>
<h1 id="improve-the-time-complexity-again"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Improve the time complexity, again</h1>
<p>Can we define an alternative to the Monge property? Yes, we can extend this to <em>algebraic Monge property</em>. Just replace <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> with some associative operation <span class="math inline">\(\oplus\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> with a total order that is ordered with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\oplus\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(a \leq a\oplus b\)</span>.</p>
<p>So it seems, using the algorithm above with little modification, we can solve the problem in <span class="math inline">\(O(kn)\)</span> time because we can just replace <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(\min\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, algebraic Monge property in general doesn't imply totally monotone matrix.</p>
<p>Consider the simple matrix, and our operation is <span class="math inline">\(\max\)</span>.</p>
<span class="math">\begin{bmatrix}
1& 2\\
0& 2
\end{bmatrix}</span>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\max(1,2)=\max(0,2)\)</span>, but the matrix is not totally monotone. <span class="math inline">\(1&gt;0\)</span> but <span class="math inline">\(2\not &gt; 2\)</span>.</p>
<p>If instead the operation is strictly compatible, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(a \oplus b&lt; a \oplus c\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(b &lt; c\)</span>, then we can always produce a totally monotone matrix. This is not the case with <span class="math inline">\(\max\)</span>.</p>
<p>Some readers who are familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp_space"><span class="math inline">\(L^p\)</span> space</a> might point out for any sequence of reals <span class="math inline">\(a_1,\ldots,a_n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon&gt;0\)</span>, there exist a <span class="math inline">\(p\geq 1\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\((\sum_{i=1}^n |a_i|^p)^{1/p} - \max_{i=1}^n |a_i|&lt; \epsilon\)</span>. So if we don't need to be exact, pick a large enough <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> as an exponential is good enough. This opens up a can of numerical analysis, and that's undesirable...</p>
<p>Good news, a more restrictive but good enough variant of the Monge property hold.</p>
<section class="theorem-environment Definition" id="Definition-8">
<span class="theorem-header"><span class="type">Definition</span><span class="index">8</span></span>
<p><span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> has the <em>strict bottleneck Monge property</em> if either of the following is true for <span class="math inline">\(1&lt;i+1&lt;j\)</span>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\max(w(i,j), w(i+1,j+1)) &lt; \max(w(i+1,j),w(i,j+1))\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\max(w(i,j), w(i+1,j+1)) = \max(w(i+1,j),w(i,j+1))\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\min(w(i,j), w(i+1,j+1)) \leq \min(w(i+1,j),w(i,j+1))\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<p>Our <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> in consideration has strict bottleneck Monge property. Because all the numbers are positive, <span class="math inline">\(w(i,j+1)&gt;w(i+1,j+1)&gt;w(i+1,j)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(w(i,j+1)&gt;w(i,j)&gt;w(i+1,j)\)</span>. A simple case check on the relation between <span class="math inline">\(w(i,j)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w(i+1,j+1)\)</span> will give the desired proof. Why this property? You can check by a case by case proof that this property implies total monotonicity.</p>

</section>
<p>There seems to be a direct proof by analyze 12 different cases, but I got too bored after the second case. One can read <span class="citation" data-cites="Bein2005455">[<a href="#ref-Bein2005455">1</a>]</span> for the proof. It doesn't contain the exact theorem, but a result that implies this one. The proof is quite involved. Their idea is to construct a new matrix with a new operation over sorted sequences of numbers instead of just numbers. Prove this matrix is strictly compatible and has the algebraic Monge property, and show this can always be done if the original matrix has the strict bottleneck Monge property.</p>
<p>The final punchline.</p>

<p>For a few hundred photos, we can afford to run it in real time. This will reach a limit once there are thousand of photos.</p>
<p>Can we do better? Yes, by considering a different kind of reduction(thank god we didn't formally define what <em>close</em> means). Instead of compute <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and try to fit <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> rows, why not just make sure each row's width is almost the width we want and scale accordingly? We want each rows to approximately have width <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, we don't really care how many rows there are.</p>
